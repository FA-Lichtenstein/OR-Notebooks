    "O'Regan gives a brief history of problems with timely delivery and reliability of software. He compares a \"software crisis\" of major delays, budget overruns, and defective software in the 1950s and 1960 to a similar crisis in bridge construction in the 1800s. In both cases, a crisis of late, over-budget, and cancelled projects, and defective products that endangered the public created an awareness of a need for engineering competence, discipline, and professionalism."
